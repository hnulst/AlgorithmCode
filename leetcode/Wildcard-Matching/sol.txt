NOTE:
    If every character between two consistent '*' matches , the older '*' can be seen as ""(no character)!!
    The sought is very brilliant.

1) save star position and last s position.
2) if ? or *p==*s, (p++,s++) go on 
3) else if *p=='*' take the star position and s position
4) else if have star , just traceback!
5) else return false;

if *s=='\0' return *p=='\0'
